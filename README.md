# You Don't Need AI for That!
You Don't Need AI for That! is a JavaScript that is built to do complicated things (complicated to a computer, anyway) without the help of 
AI. There are a few steps to using it. The first is to download the JavaScript file index.js from this repository. Then, you must put your 
JavaScript in a script tag with an `src` attrabute with a file path to wherever the index.js file is to implement the library. Then, once 
the library is implemented, you must give the training data and the data you wish to evaluate. This repository is built to give a "yes" or 
"no" evaluations, so you must string multiple implementations of this library to make multiple-choice evaluations. The training data is 
the things that should get a "yes" answer from the computer. The training data must be given in numbers, usally converted from another 
type of data. The conversion must all be done in the same way, though you may use any kind of conversion you wish. Assign the training 
data to the `trainingData` variable in the form of new numbers in an array. The data you wish to evaluate shall also be in the form of 
numbers, converted in the same way as the training data. It should be put into the `newData` variable, one number at a time and in the 
form of a regular number in a regular variable.
